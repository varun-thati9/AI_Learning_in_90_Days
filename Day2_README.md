# ✅ Day 2 – Python OOP Basics: Classes & Objects

### **Basic Level**
1. Class `Car` with attributes `brand`, `model`, `year`. Print attributes.  
2. Class `Person` with method `introduce()`.  
3. Class `Rectangle` with method to calculate area.  
4. Class `Book` with `details()` method.  
5. Class `Dog` with method `bark()`.  

### **Mid Level**
1. `BankAccount` class with `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `display_balance()`.  
2. `Student` class with `average()` and `result()` methods.  
3. `Circle` class with `area()` and `perimeter()`.  
4. `Employee` class with `increase_salary(percent)`.  
5. `ShoppingCart` class with `add_item()`, `remove_item()`, `total_price()`.  

### **Advanced Level**
1. **Encapsulation**: Private balance in `Account` with safe deposit/withdraw methods.  
2. **Inheritance**: Base class `Vehicle`; derived classes `Car`, `Bike`.  
3. **Polymorphism**: `Dog` and `Cat` classes with different `sound()` implementations.  
4. **Class & Static Methods**: `Temperature` class with conversions and unit change.  
5. **Mini Project**: `Shape` base class with `area()` method → subclasses `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Triangle`. Use polymorphism to calculate areas.
